        "Staking your S involves a 14-day waiting period if you choose to withdraw.",
        "When staking your S, choose a reputable validator carefully.",
        "If your validator is penalized for misconduct or errors in their setup, it could impact your delegated S stake as well.",
        "At Sonics launch, the total supply of S is 3.175 billion.",
        "As decided by multiple governance proposals, the additions below will gradually be implemented into the tokenomics of the S token.",
        "An additional 6% of the 3.175 billion S will be minted six months after Sonic launches exclusively used for the airdrop program, rewarding both Fantom Opera and Sonic users and builders.",
        "The airdrop features an innovative burn mechanism that rewards active participation and gradually reduces the total supply of S tokens.",
        "Six months after Sonic launches, the network will mint additional S tokens to:",
        "Grow the team and scale operations to drive increased adoption",
        "Implement robust marketing initiatives and DeFi onboarding campaigns To fund this program, an additional 1.5% of S will be minted annually for six years, starting six months after the mainnet launch.",
        "However, to guard against ination, the network will burn newly minted tokens not used during the year, ensuring that 100% of all newly minted tokens from this initiative are allocated toward network growth rather than being held by the treasury for later use.",
        "For example, if Sonic Labs uses only 5,000,000 tokens in the rst year, the network will burn the remaining 42,625,000 tokens.",
        "We are migrating block rewards from Fantom Opera to Sonic.",
        "As validators and stakers move to Sonic, Opera's block rewards will be reduced to zero, and the saved funds will be used to reward Sonic validators.",
        "The Sonic Foundation will maintain Opera validators for now.",
        "To achieve a 3.5% APR for Sonic without causing further ination in the rst four years, we're reallocating the remaining FTM block rewards from Opera to Sonic.",
        "These rewards are technically part of the initial 3.175 billion S supply, but the circulating supply at launch will be ~2.88 billion tokens.",
        "The annual difference of 70 million tokens will be distributed",
        "as validator rewards over the rst four years, avoiding the need to mint new S tokens during this period for block rewards.",
        "As a result, Opera's APR dropped to zero upon Sonic's launch.",
        "To preserve value and avoid new inationary rewards at Sonic's inception, we will not mint new tokens for block rewards during the initial four years, as stated.",
        "After that period, S block rewards will resume by minting new tokens at a rate of 1.75% per year to reward validators.",
        "We have three burn mechanisms in place that will decrease the emission of new S tokens.",
        "To help secure the Sonic network by running a validator and staking a certain amount of S, you can earn block rewards as well as transaction fees paid by users on Sonic.",
        "Fee Monetization Burn If a user submits a transaction on an app that isn't participating in FeeM, 50% of the transaction fee will be burned.",
        "Airdrop Burn Users who choose not to wait for the full 270-day maturation period for 75% of their airdrop will lose a portion of their S tokens, which will be burned.",
        "Ongoing Funding Burn From the 47,625,000 S tokens minted annually in the rst six years of Sonic to fund growth, the network will burn any of the tokens not used during the year.",
        "The target reward rate for validators on Sonic is 3.5% when 50% of the network is staked.",
        "The network mints tokens each epoch to provide this, except during Sonic's rst four years when rewards stem from block rewards migrated from Opera, as outlined above.",
        "if all S tokens are staked, the annual reward is 1.75%.",
        "Conversely, if only 25% of S tokens are staked, the annual reward is 7%.",
        "Network fees are generated when users pay gas to interact with the network.",
        "Validators earn a percentage of these fees, which are distributed equally among all staked S tokens.",
        "For a detailed breakdown of how much a validator earns from gas fees, see here.",
        "The Ecosystem Vault was initially launched on Fantom Opera to fuel the community ecosystem by sharing a percentage of total fees on the network with select apps in the community.",
        "To extend this program to the Sonic chain, we'll revise the program to allocate quarterly disbursements from the Ecosystem Vault to the Sonic Community Council , an independently operated collective of ecosystem members who actively contribute to elevating the Sonic community via user-based programs, developer onboarding, and app support.",

        "Speed: Asset bridging is processed in intervals called \"heartbeats\" to ensure gas eciency  every 10 minutes from Ethereum to Sonic and hourly in reverse.",
        "At launch, the Sonic Gateway will only support bridging four tokens from Ethereum  USDC, EURC, WETH, and FTM.",
        "Our roadmap includes adding more tokens and introducing a permissionless mechanism for anyone to add new tokens for bridging.",
        "While Sonic is not an L2, we are active participants on Ethereum as we spend ETH through the Sonic Gateway contracts.",
        "The Sonic Gateway includes a fail-safe mechanism that allows users to retrieve bridged assets on the original chain if the Gateway experiences a failure.",
        "In the highly unlikely event that the Gateway or the Sonic chain is down for 14 consecutive days, users are able to reclaim their bridged assets on Ethereum.",
        "The 14-day period is immutable and cannot be altered by Sonic Labs or any third party after deployment.",
        "Importantly, this period is not intended as a contest period but rather as an essential feature that ensures users retain custody of their bridged funds on the originating chain.",
        "Assets bridged through the Sonic Gateway are processed in intervals called \"heartbeats\", ensuring gas eciency by bundling bridging transactions together.",
        "For assets moving from Ethereum to Sonic, these heartbeats occur every 10 minutes, while Sonic to Ethereum heartbeats occur every hour.",
        "During each interval, all queued transactions are processed simultaneously.",
        "While this system reduces costs, it may introduce waiting periods for users needing their assets bridged immediately.",
        "To address this, Fast Lane allows users to bypass the wait for a small fee and have their bridge transaction processed instantly.",
        "Fast Lane works by adding an additional heartbeat to the Gateway.",
        "This means all other queued assets waiting to be bridged are also processed immediately, effectively accelerating the entire network.",
        "By using Fast Lane, users not only avoid delays and seize timely opportunities but also contribute to the broader ecosystem's eciency, ensuring faster bridging for everyone involved.",
        "By enabling canonical access to native assets from other layer-1 platforms, the Gateway fosters a secure and thriving economy on the Sonic network.",
        "Users can directly access these canonical assets on Sonic while maintaining asset security.",
        "The Sonic Gateway thus provides safe access to high-demand assets that natively exist outside the Sonic network.",
        "No, only assets bridged through the Sonic Gateway are secured by the failsafe mechanism.",
        "Additionally, if a user spends the tokens bridged through the Sonic Gateway, e.g.",
        "by swapping to another token, these tokens may not be recoverable.",
        "In the future, Sonic Labs may provide specic recovery mechanisms for some nancial protocols on Sonic.",
        "No, Sonic operates independently as its own layer-1 platform and does not rely on Ethereums state.",
        "Instead, the Sonic Gateway uses Merkle proofs on both Ethereum and Sonic to verify the rightful owners of bridged assets.",
        "These assets can be redeemed on Ethereum by their rightful ownership regardless of the Sonic Gateways status.",
        "L2 platforms store their transactions on Ethereum, using methods like blobs, which allow these transactions to be reconstructed and contested.",
        "This is crucial for resolving any security issues that may arise after the transaction is submitted by the user .",
        "However, this approach leads to substantial storage demands on Ethereum, costing millions annually.",
        "Our approach is more ecient as we store only a Merkle root hash and the block heights of both blockchains at regular intervals (e.g.",
        "Does the Sonic Gateway also secure third-party bridges?",
        "hourly) through the Sonic Gateway, which uses Sonics own trusted validator set.",

        "It's a critical element for effectively thwarting attempts by malicious actors to manipulate the network or its data.",
        "Sonic uses Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance in combination with directed acyclic graphs to achieve consensus.",
        "Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a consensus mechanism designed to enable decentralized systems to function correctly in the presence of malicious or faulty nodes.",
        "It is named after the Byzantine generals problem, which is an idea that illustrates the diculties of achieving consensus in a decentralized system when some of the participants may be acting in bad faith.",
        "In a PBFT system, nodes in a network communicate with each other to reach a consensus on the system's state, even when malicious actors are involved.",
        "this, they send messages back and forth that contain information about the system's state and the actions they propose.",
        "Each node veries the message it receives, and if it determines the message is valid, it sends a message to all the other nodes to indicate its agreement.",
        "In the context of cryptocurrencies, the message with which all nodes must agree is the blockchain, a ledger that stores a history of transactions ",
        "Before the invention of cryptocurrencies, the major aw with PBFT systems was their susceptibility to Sybil attacks.",
        "If an attacker controlled a sucient number of nodes, they could control the entire system; there needed to be a deterrent to launch many nodes.",
        "Bitcoin rst solved this problem with proof-of-work, forcing nodes to invest considerable energy to partake in the consensus.",
        "Since then, many new solutions have been developed, such as proof-of-stake, which forces nodes to deposit tokens with monetary value, which Sonic uses.",
        "Hence, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a mechanism to achieve consensus.",
        "It forms a functioning decentralized system when coupled with proof-of-work or proof-ofstake to deter participants from messing with the network",
        "However, Sonic has decided to innovate on this mechanism by using Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance.",
        "With Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance , nodes can reach consensus independently and are not required to exchange nal blocks sequentially to conrm transactions.",
        "At the same time, they exchange blocks, which is required to achieve consensus, and this is done asynchronously.",
        "Each node veries transactions independently and is not required to incorporate blocks created by other miners or validators in sequential order.",
        "This is opposed to PBFT systems, such as Bitcoin, in which the majority of nodes must agree to a block before it becomes nal, which they must then sequentially order into their blockchain record.",
        "This slows down the network during high trac; more on this in the consensus mechanism section further below.",
        "Now that we have a basic understanding of Byzantine fault tolerance, lets delve into the second part of Sonics consensus mechanism, directed acyclic graphs.",
        "A graph is a non-linear data structure used to represent objects, called vertices, and the connections between them, called edges.",
        "A directed graph dictates that all its edges, the connections between objects, only ow in a certain direction.",
        "An acyclic graph does not contain any cycles, which makes it impossible to follow a sequence of edges and return to the starting point.",
        "As such, a directed acyclic graph only ows in a certain direction and never repeats or cycles.",
        "The diagram below is an example of a directed acyclic graph.",
        "Each oval is a vertex, and the lines connecting them are edges.",
        "The vertices only connect in one direction, downwards, and never repeat.",
        "In our consensus algorithm, an event containing transactions is represented by a vertex in a DAG, and edges represent the relationships between the events.",
        "The edges may represent the dependencies between events indicating the order in which they were added to the DAG.",
        "Events can be created and added to the DAG concurrently.",
        "The blocks do not need to be added in a specic order, which enables the system to achieve faster transaction times.",
        "It is not limited by the requirement to incorporate blocks sequentially, as is the case with many of the biggest blockchains currently availabl",
        "Sonic uses a proof-of-stake, DAG-based, ABFT consensus mechanism.",
        "In this mechanism, each validator has its own local block DAG and batches incoming transactions into event blocks, which they add to their DAG as vertices  each event block is a vertex in the validators DAG that is full of transactions.",
        "Before creating a new event block, a validator must rst validate all transactions in its current event block and part of the ones it has received from other nodes; these are the event blocks it has received during the asynchronous exchange of event blocks explained in the section above.",
        "The new event block then is communicated with other nodes through the same asynchronous event communication.",
        "During this communication, nodes share their own event blocks, and the ones they received from other nodes, with other validators that incorporate them in their own local DAGs.",
        "Consequently, this spreads all information through the network.",
        "The process is asynchronous as the event blocks shared between validators are not required to be sequential.",
        "Unlike most blockchains, this DAG-based approach does not force validators to work on the current block that is being produced, which places restrictions on transaction speed and nality.",
        "Validators are free to create their own event blocks that contain transactions and share these with other validators on the network asynchronously, creating a nonlinear record of transactions.",
        "As an event block is sent and propagated across validators, it becomes a root event block once the majority of validators have received and agreed upon it.",
        "This root event block will eventually be ordered and included in the main chain, which is a blockchain that contains the nal consensus among all event blocks that have become root event blocks.",
        "Every validator stores and updates a copy of the main chain, which provides quick access to previous transaction history to process new event blocks more eciently.",
        "As such, Sonic's consensus mechanism combines a DAG-based approach that allows validators to conrm transactions asynchronously, which greatly increases speed, with a nal blockchain that orders and stores all nal transactions immutably and indenitely.",
        "Currently, the process of submitting a transaction and having it added to the Sonic main chain through the consensus mechanism takes approximately 1-2 seconds.",
        "A validator node batches the transaction into a new event block",
        "The event block becomes a root event block once the majority of nodes have received it",
        "The root event block is ordered and nalized into the main chain as a block When a user explores Sonic through a block explorer, they view the nal blocks on the Sonic main chain.",
        "Event block generation and exchange in validators' DAGs is an internal process only and is not visible to end users.",
        "To better understand the technical aspects of Sonic's consensus mechanism, review the paper on Fantom Opera's consensus mechanism, as Sonic's design is a continuation of it: Lachesis: Scalable Asynchronous BFT on DAG Streams.",
        "Sonic uses database storage to store its world state, which includes account information, virtual machine bytecode, smart contract storage, etc.",
        "This database has a feature called live pruning, which removes historical data automatically, reducing storage needs for validators as the blockchain grows.",
        "Previously, pruning required validator nodes to go oine, risking nancial and operational issues for them.",
        "Now, validators can use live pruning without going oine, ensuring continuous operation and saving on disk space and costs by discarding historical data in real-time.",
        "Live pruning works by splitting the database into two types: LiveDB and ArchiveDB.",
        "The LiveDB contains the world state of the current block only, whereas the ArchiveDB contains the world states of all historical blocks.",
        "Validators use only LiveDB, while archive nodes have both LiveDB and ArchiveDB to handle historical data requests through the RPC interface.",
        "Sonic's database storage uses ecient tree-like or hierarchical structures, which simplies data retrieval.",
        "Importantly, it still provides cryptographic signatures for a world state and archive capabilities using an incremental version of a prex algorithm.",
        "Additionally, it utilizes a native disk format instead of storing the world state indirectly through key-value stores like LevelDB or PebbleDB.",
        "The Sonic chain is secured using a proof-of-stake mechanism.",
        "In PoS on Sonic, validators must lock their S ; if they act maliciously in the network, they lose their tokens.",
        "Validators are incentivized to act in the network's best interest as their own funds are at stake.",
        "Since validators do not need to perform computations, this approach is a much more energy-ecient alternative to proof-of-work for achieving resistance to Sybil attacks.",
        "A Sybil attack is an attack where a malicious actor runs a large number of validators to allow them an unsafe amount of inuence over the network.",
        "PoS makes it costly to set up these validators and allows the network to punish validators for malicious behavior, increasing the costs of attacks.",
        "Sonic requires nodes to lock up at least 500,000 S to validate transactions and produce blocks.",
        "Sonic has undergone extensive security audits across its core components to ensure the highest level of security for our users and developers.",
        "The Sonic Gateway is our native bridge between Ethereum and Sonic.",
